          How do I fell in love with computers
        </h2>
        <p>
          My name is Wesley Júnior and I love computers since I was a kid (I
          spent most of my time installing malwares on my grandpa's computer...
          He had to install a Linux distribution for me, because I was curious
          and kept trying to install every game I saw on the internet).
          Nevertheless, when I got my own computer I was twelve, and didn't get
          internet yet, then I had to find a way to have fun, so every day when
          I got home, I turned on my PC with Windows XP installed, and explored
          everything I could, it was at those moments that I fell in love with
          computers. A few years later, I had my first contact with Linux
          distributions,
          <a target="_blank" href="https://linuxmint.com">Linux Mint</a> was my
          first distribution and I installed it in dual boot with Windows 10. I
          tried several debian-based distributions, but I didn't like it that
          much, though when I tried
          <a target="_blank" href="https://manjaro.org">Manjaro Linux</a> I just
          loved and use it so far.

          My Goals
        </h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently studying C, JavaScript and Node.js and my main goal is
          to became a Computer Scientist (You can check my roadmap
          <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wesleyjrz/cs-roadmap">here</a>), 
          I want to contribute with open-source projects as well, make games
          and have fun programming a lot of new apps. I want to enter in a
          university, maybe a British one, like Oxford or another. Learn new
          languages is another goal I have, I'm not fluent in English yet (My
          current level is advanced intermediate), but I'm already studying
          Japanese, because I love Japan as much as I love England, and I wish
          to live in one of those countries someday (Btw, I'm from Brazil).

          My Hobbies
        </h2>
        <p>
          I like to study, learn new languages, talk with random people
          sometimes, listen to music (specially rap and heavy metal), drink
          coffee (with no sugar), write stories and poems, read books, manga and
          light novel, watch anime, play retro games (SNES, GBA, NDS, etc), play
          RPG with friends and obviously I love to code.
