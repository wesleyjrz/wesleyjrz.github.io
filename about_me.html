            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Wesley, I like computers since I was a kid (I spent so much time installing viruses on
                my
                grandpa's computer, old times... He had to install Linux because of me lol). Though, when I get my first
                computer I was twelve years old and I did not have internet, so I had to find a way to have fun, then
                when I
                arrived from school, I turned on my computer every day and I explored everything possible on Windows XP,
                it
                was at those moments I fell in love with the computing world. A few years later, I had my first contact
                with
                Linux systems, and Linux Mint was the first distribution that I installed in dual boot with my Windows
                10.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the way, I already had studied HTML before I use Linux, but I always gave up 'cause my computer was
                not
                that good... And Windows 10 didn't help so much. However, when I started to use Linux I could learn a
                lot
                about programming and even now I don't have the best setup, just a simple computer, but I'm trying to do
                my
                best. I will always do my best because I love programming &hearts;. I'm studying front-end and web development and I intend to go to computer science college and improve my
                knowledge. For now, I'm focusing on HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and also my English grammar and speaking.
            </p>
            <p>
                About my hobbies, I like to learn languages, I'm studying English and French, I also like Japanese and I
                want to learn it someday. I love music, coffee (without sugar), sometimes I write poems, and I also like
                to
                read and collect books. And I like to play chess too.
                This year, my favourite OS is Manjaro Linux XFCE and I want to use it with GNOME 40 when a buy a new
                computer, the best TV Serie I've watched is Prison Break (I cried a lot...). The best book I have read
                is
                "The Book Thief" by Markus Zusak. My goals are to be fluent in English, get a job with web development,
                and
                build my office with a nice setup.
