          <p>
              My name is Wesley Júnior and I love computers since I was a kid (I spent most of my time installing malwares on my grandpa's computer... He had to install a Linux distribution for me, because I was curious and kept trying to install every game I saw on the internet). Nevertheless, when I got my own computer I was twelve, and didn't get internet yet, then I had to find a way to have fun, so every day when I got home, I turned on my PC with Windows XP installed, and explored everything I could, it was at those moments that I fell in love with computers. A few years later, I had my first contact with Linux distributions, <a target="_blank" href="https://linuxmint.com">Linux Mint</a> was my first distribution and I installed it in dual boot with Windows 10. I tried several debian-based distributions, but I didn't like it that much, though when I tried <a target="_blank" href="https://manjaro.org">Manjaro Linux</a> I just loved and use it so far.

          <h2><br><img src="img/target.png" width="48" alt="Target"><br>My Goals</h2>
          <p>
              I'm currently studying C, JavaScript and Node.js and my main goal is to became a Computer Scientist (You can check my roadmap <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wesleyjrz/cs-roadmap">here</a>), I want to contribute with open-source projects as well, make games and have fun programming a lot of new apps. I want to enter in a university, maybe a British one, like Oxford or another. Learn new languages is another goal I have, I'm not fluent in English yet (My current level is advanced intermediate), but I'm already studying Japanese, because I love Japan as much as I love England, and I wish to live in one of those countries someday (Btw, I'm from Brazil).

          <h2><br><img src="img/gamepad.png" width="48" alt="Gamepad"><br>My Hobbies</h2>
          <p>
              I like to study, learn new languages, talk with random people sometimes, listen to music (specially rap and heavy metal), drink coffee (with no sugar), write stories and poems, read books, manga and light novel, watch anime, play retro games (SNES, GBA, NDS, etc), play RPG with friends and obviously I love to code.
