        <h2>About me.</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Wesley, I like computers since I was a kid (I spent so much time installing viruses on my grandpa's computer, old times... He had to install Linux because of me lol). Though, when I get my first computer I was twelve years old and I did not have internet, so I had to find a way to have fun, then when I arrived from school, I turned on my computer every day and I explored everything possible on Windows XP, it was at those moments I fell in love with the computing world. A few years later, I had my first contact with Linux systems, and Linux Mint was the first distribution that I installed in dual boot with my Windows 10.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the way, I already had studied HTML before I use Linux, but I always gave up 'cause my computer was not that good... And Windows 10 didn't help so much. However, when I started to use Linux I could learn a lot about programming and even now I don't have the best setup, just a simple computer, but I'm trying to do my best. I will always do my best because I love programming &hearts;
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm studying front-end and web development and I intend to go to computer science college and improve my knowledge. For now, I'm focusing on HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and also my English grammar and speaking.
        </p>
        <p>
            About my hobbies, I like to learn languages, I'm studying English and French, I also like Japanese and I want to learn it someday. I love music, coffee (without sugar), sometimes I write poems, and I also like to read and collect books. And I like to play chess too.
        </p>
        <p>
            This year, my favourite OS is Manjaro Linux XFCE and I want to use it with GNOME 40 when a buy a new computer, the best TV Serie I've watched is Prison Break (I cried a lot...). The best book I have read is "The Book Thief" by Markus Zusak. My goals are to be fluent in English, get a job with web development, and build my office with a nice setup.
